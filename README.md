# Movie-Genre-Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. The model leverages multiple machine learning techniques, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN1D (1D Convolutional Neural Networks), and Naive Bayes to analyze and classify movie plot summaries into appropriate genres.

# Problem Statement
Given a movie plot summary, the goal is to predict the movieâ€™s genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.). The challenge lies in extracting relevant features from unstructured text data (the plot summaries) and applying machine learning techniques to make accurate genre predictions.

# Approach
## 1. Data Collection
The dataset used for this project is the 'wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv' from Kaggle, that contains a collection of movies and their corresponding plot summaries. Each movie is labeled with its genre, which can be one or more categories (e.g., Comedy, Drama, etc.).

## 2. Preprocessing
Before training the models, the plot summaries undergo several preprocessing steps:

* Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words.
* Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words like "and," "the," "in," etc.
* Padding: Ensuring all sequences have the same length for LSTM input.

## 3. Modeling
The project utilizes three different machine learning models for genre prediction:

### 3.1 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequential data like text. It is capable of remembering long-term dependencies in sequences, which is useful for understanding the context and sentiment of movie plot summaries.

### 3.2 CNN1D (1D Convolutional Neural Network)
CNNs are typically used in image processing, but they can also be applied to text data. A 1D CNN is used to learn spatial hierarchies in sequences, extracting important features from the plot summaries to make genre predictions.

### 3.3 Naive Bayes
A traditional machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem, Naive Bayes is used as a baseline model. It is simple yet effective for text classification tasks, where it computes the probability of each genre based on the frequency of words in the plot summaries.

## 4. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.
